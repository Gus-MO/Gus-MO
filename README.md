# Hi, I'm Gustavo Martins,

a Physics student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais who loves discovering and tackling new challenges.

My academic background has brought unique and rigorous competencies to my set of analytical and problem-solving skills.

Outside of university, I have gained experiences that allowed me to develop and enhance communication and teamwork skills, as well as exposure to data analysis in the field of distance education.

I am currently in a phase of continuous learning and eagerly look forward to new experiences that challenge and improve my data analysis capabilities.
